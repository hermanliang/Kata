     * Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
     * <p>
     * The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until
     * the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character,
     * takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical
     * digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
     * <p>
     * The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral
     * number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
     * <p>
     * If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid
     * integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty
     * or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
     * <p>
     * If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.
     * <p>
     * Note:
     * <p>
     * Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
     * Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers
     * within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. If the numerical
     * value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2^31 − 1) or
     * INT_MIN (−2^31) is returned.
     *
     * @param input input string
     * @return convert string to integer
