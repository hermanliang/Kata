     * 200. Number of Islands [Medium]
     * <p>
     * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
     * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
     * You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * <p>
     * Input:
     * 11110
     * 11010
     * 11000
     * 00000
     * <p>
     * Output: 1
     * Example 2:
     * <p>
     * Input:
     * 11000
     * 11000
     * 00100
     * 00011
     * <p>
     * Output: 3
     *
     * @param grid a 2D grid map
     * @return number of islands
